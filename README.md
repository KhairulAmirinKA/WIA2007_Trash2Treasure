## Project Objectives

1. To increase the number of users who practice waste management and recycling by 5% within 2 weeks. This aims to create a user-friendly platform that helps individuals to make responsible waste management choices. By offering easy-to-use tools and features, this app focuses on the efficient sorting, recycling, and disposal of waste, promoting a cleaner and more sustainable environment for the communities.
2. To increase the public knowledge of waste management by 5% within 1 week. Emphasizing the information on the consequences of improper waste management and the positive impact of responsible practices gives greater awareness and motivates communities to take environmentally responsible actions.
3. To reduce the average time, it takes for users to manage the waste by 10% within 2 weeks. This focuses on providing practical resources, which help users stay organized, do convenient disposal and guide them on how to properly handle different types of waste, making the process more transparent and accessible.
4. To reduce the illegal dumping practices within the communities by 5% in 2 weeks. Communities are encouraged to utilize legal and environmentally friendly disposal methods by promoting responsible waste management and offering accessible alternatives.
